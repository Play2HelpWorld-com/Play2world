                                                Play2Worldcoin App. In early Q1 2022, Play2Worldcoin had 65M users; by early
                                                May 2022, it was 76M. The number of users is rapidly growing, and we

                                            PLAY2WORLD is minted solely by verified game. Therefore, a stable number of
                                            users increases minting “input”. An increase in users increases the input. A change
                                            in user habits – all users playing more because of intention and rewards – makes
                                            the input rise exponentially.

                                            Each PLAY2WORLD will require more points to mint than the last. To achieve our
                                            vision of making the world more active, PLAY2WORLD will be harder to mint with
                                            time. Not only does this incentivize users to get moving now – as their Play
                                            generates more PLAY2WORLD today than tomorrow – it preserves the utility of
                                            PLAY2WORLD as the model represents an ever increasing marginal cost of
                                            production.

                                            The open economy of the game is enabled by PLAY2WORLD. It is a new market, a
                                            new economy, in which anyone, anywhere, can be rewarded in increasingly
                                            attractive ways, for any form of activity.

                                            Play Validators are required to verify the validity of Play and update the blockchain
                                            accordingly. Consistent and accurate Play validation is fundamental to ensuring the
                                            integrity of the underlying asset

                                            The current process at Play2Worldcoin – and the process applied to the launch
                                            claim – is such that: for every 1,000 verified points, 1 Play2World coin is awarded.
                                            The validator receives the raw data from the recording device, and implements an
                                            algorithm to detect fraudulent behavior, and ensure only true Play is rewarded.
                                            Play2World Ltd is the only Play Validator as of launch.

                                            Going forward, we intend to decentralize the validation process to enable third
                                            parties, such as activity trackers, playing games, and app developers to operate as
                                            Play Validators. These tracking services will have to stake PLAY2WORLD to operate
                                            as Play Validators. In return, for their contribution, they will receive a % fee for all
                                            transactions they process. By decentralization, we enable new markets for different
                                            types of activity, and expand the breadth of the open economy of Play.

                                            A <strong>PLAY2WORLD holder</strong> could contribute their data to an aggregate data pool,
                                            resulting in features such as global activity indices. Insurers, doctors,
                                            academic institutions, and investors would pay for this data – and you,
                                            the creator and owner of that data, would receive the reward. The

                                            There is an uncapped supply of PLAY2WORLD to incentivize Play in perpetuity.
                                        </li>
                                        <br>

                                            This is balanced with a controlled, exponentially decreasing rate of inflation –
                                            PLAY2WORLD minting difficulty is exponential – such that inflation becomes asymptotic to zero.

                                        <li  style="color: floralwhite;">
                                            This encourages adoption and Play, as Play today generates higher rewards than Play tomorrow.
                                        </li>
                                        <li style="color: floralwhite;">
                                            Supply of new PLAY2WORLD depends only on activity already submitted,
                                            meaning that minted tokens are backed by the value on activity and nothing else.
                                            Uncapped supply with exponentially-decreasing inflation will ensure motivation to
                                            be active in perpetuity while consistently increasing value perception of
                                            PLAY2WORLD.

                                            The open economy of Play introduces a new way to think of exchange. You do not
                                            have to part with something valuable to gain something else. The Play you exchange
                                            has already benefited you and, even better, it is easily accessible, and easily
                                            producible.

                                            It is also self-fulfilling. When you exercise, endorphins create a positive association
                                            to sustain the behavioral change. PLAY2WORLD enters the positive feedback loop to
                                            mean that, not only will you feel better, you will have material benefit for it, further
                                            prompting the continuation and sustainment of that exercise, making you feel
                                            better, creating more rewards, and so on. If exercise is self-fulfilling, so is
                                            PLAY2WORLD.
